# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project written for my WTWR application (see the link below for front-end application) provides a custom API and server from which the WTWR app can draw its data. This project makes heavy use of express and mongoose throughout, including specific things such as express routers, and mongoose models and schemas. I have written the project in such a way that attempts to maintain a more organized code base, especially with regard to controllers and routes by dividing these things into separate files for clarity and ease of use.

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
